## iOS Networking

* __NSURL__
	* used to store location of a resource on a remote server
	* or the path of a local file on disk
	* use URLs for interapplication communication
* __NSURLRequest__
	* Wraps around NSURL to give us more granular control over the request itself
	* E.g.:

			let urlString = "https://www.google.com"
			let url = NSURL (string: urlString)!
			let request = NSURLRequest(URL: url)
			request.HTTPMethod = "GET"		//default

* __NSURLSession__
	* refers to requests as 'TASKS'
	* each NSURLSession task is a subclass of NSURLSessionTask
